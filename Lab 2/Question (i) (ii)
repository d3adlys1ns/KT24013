Answer to the question number (i) :
here double asterisk is needed in the function insert_atFront() because we want to modify the head thus passing double pointer of head enables us to change the head.

Answer to the question number (ii) :
void insert_atPosition(node **head, int pos, int v)
node *searchNode(node *head, int n)
bool deleteNode(node **head, int n)
